    "1) KNN regression does **NOT** predict well beyond the range of the predictors in the training data. Linear regression can be used to address this problem.\n",
    "2) In KNN regression, the method gets significantly slower as the training dataset grows. Linear regression can be used to address this problem.\n",
    "3) In linear regression, standardization does not affect the fit (it does affect the coefficients in the equation, though!)\n",
    "4) A straight line can be defined by two numbers, the vertical intercept and the slope. The intercept tells us what the prediction is when all of the predictors are equal to 0; and the slope tells us what unit increase in the target/response variable we predict given a unit increase in the predictor variable. KNN regression, as simple as it is to implement and understand, has no such interpretability from its wiggly line.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Disadvantages of Linear Regression when compared to KNN-regression:**</u>  \n",
    "1) When the relationship between the target and the predictor is not linear, but instead some other shape (e.g. curved or oscillating).  In these cases the prediction model from a simple linear regression will underfit (have high bias), meaning that model/predicted values does not match the actual observed values very well. Such a model would probably have a quite high $\\text{RMSE}$ when assessing model goodness of fit on the training data and a quite high $\\text{RMSPE}$ when assessing model prediction quality on a test data set.\n",
